A forum user requested a stopwatch timer, here is what I've done.

Big Ben, named after the famous clock in London.

This provides timers to both count down and count up.  For both, you can either start at 00:00:00 or enter a starting time.

The default settings provides for one timer, but there is a toggle on the window and on the Settings page to allow multiple timers.  When doing multiple timers, you can enter a name for it.

This is the timer with the Multiple option disabled:

This is with Multiple enabled, showing three timers.  The top one is not running, the second is in a count-down mode and the third is in a count-up mode

Controls available are:

Control	Description                                                                         
Name	Available only in the multiple setting, allows you to give a name to the timer
Up/Down	Specifies the direction of the count.  Default is to count up.
Entry Fields	Available when not running, one each or Hours, Minutes and Seconds
^	Available when Multiple is enabled.  If enabled, moves the timer up one in the list
v	Available when Multiple is enabled.  If enabled, moves the timer down one in the list
+	Adds a new timer
-	Deletes the current timer
Reset	Resets timer to initial values
Start	Starts the timer
Stop	Stops the timer
Time Warp and Pauses

These timers are keeping track of game time.  They work off of the KSP clock, and deal gracefully with both Time Warp and pausing the game

Usage

The toolbar button is available in the Space Center, Flight and Tracking Station screens, it looks like a stopwatch.  You don't have to keep them visible, once you set the timers, you can hide them until you need to know what time they are at.  Time will be kept, nothing will be lost. When ready, click the Start button of the timer you want to use

When using a countdown timer, the time will be displayed in red when the time gets below zero.
